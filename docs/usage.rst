Usage
=====

This page provides an overview of the basic workflows for using smudgy.

.. note::
   A streamlined usage figure will be added here soon to visually summarize the main steps and options.

Typical Workflow
----------------

1. **Prepare your particle or point cloud data**
   - Load or generate your positions and field values (e.g., masses, densities).

2. **Create a PointCloud object**
   - Initialize with your data and simulation box parameters.

3. **Choose a deposition or interpolation method**
   - Options include grid-based deposition (CIC, TSC, SPH) or interpolation to arbitrary coordinates.

4. **Run the computation**
   - Call the appropriate method to deposit or interpolate your data.

5. **Analyze or visualize the results**
   - Use the output grid or interpolated values for further analysis or plotting.

More detailed examples and code snippets can be found in the Tutorials section.
