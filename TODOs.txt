TODO's

Interpolation
[ ] double check the h_ij computation for the isotropic case
[ ] derive/implent with the paper the formulas for the anisotropic case
  (I guess since the metric is deformed, the distance computations need to change)
[ ] rewrite test notebook

Deposition
[+] port the p2g function to the main class and rename it
[+] expand the num_grid parameter to define the number of cells in each dimension - adopt cpp/py functions
[+] streamline the deposition code in ops.py
[+] make sure we have per axis periodicity

[+] test the entire pipeline - test the accordance between python / cpp
[ ] think about the integral estimation for the sph cases and implement solution
  (e.g. if particle is enclosed in top right of cell, then estimating the integral at the midpoint is wrong)

Both
[ ] test openMP acceleration
[ ] add verbosity to the whole class


Features (so I don't forget)

Interpolation
+ many kernels

Deposition
+ many kernels
+ per axis periodic boundary conditions settings
+ non-uniform grids: varying pixel / voxel sizes for each axis possible
