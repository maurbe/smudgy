**TODO's**

Interpolation
[ ] port functionality to cpp where possible
[ ] write test notebooks

Deposition
[ ] change integral estimation to fixed number of kernel evaluations at predefined locations:
    then, in for loop for each kernel position, e.g. 32^dim, identify the parent cell and deposit 
    that fraction into cell
  (e.g. if particle is enclosed in top right of cell, then estimating the integral at the midpoint is wrong)
[ ] primary selection of neighbors in anisotropic case;
    Anisotropic kNN (Marinho-pure)
	  •	Neighbor search uses Mahalanobis distance:
      \delta = |H^{-1}(r_p - r_q)|
    •	Outer neighbor satisfies \delta = 1
[ ] make sure we have per axis periodicity -> we do not, since cKdTree does not support that.

Both
[ ] test / debug openMP acceleration -> need to troubleshoot on Intel cluster
[ ] add verbosity to the whole class


**Features** (so I don't forget)

Interpolation
+ many kernels possible

Deposition
+ many kernels possible
+ per axis periodic boundary conditions settings possible: but only for functions that do not use the cKdTree...
+ non-uniform grids: varying pixel / voxel sizes for each axis possible
